# installing qemu with kvm support
sudo apt install qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils

# check if kvm kernel module is enabled
sudo modinfo kvm

# download debian wheezy image
curl --output=debian.qcow2 https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/amd64/debian_wheezy_amd64_standard.qcow2

# run debian in qemu
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda debian.qcow2 -m 1024 -nographic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -net nic
# port 2222 on the host is forwarded to 22 (ssh) on the guest

# to ssh to the virtual machine
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost # password is `root`

# check internet access in the virtualized os (qemu doesn't support icmp by default, so ping won't work)
