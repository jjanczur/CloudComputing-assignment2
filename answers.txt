CPU benchmark questions:
1. Look at your LINPACK measurements. How do they differ between the platforms, what are the main reasons for the differences?

Native - Avg. 3387000,94 KFLOPS
KVM    - Avg. 3383373,01 KFLOPS
No KVM - Avg.   49485,31 KFLOPS
Docker - Avg. 3435431,58 KFLOPS

Benchmarks on native machine, KVM and Docker virtual machines yield similar results. CPU on QEMU without KVM is much slower. This happens, because emulation of the CPU done by QEMU is software based, thus it applies noticeable overhead.

Memory benchmark questions:
1. Look at your memsweep measurements. How do they differ between the platforms, what are the main reasons for the differences?

Native - Avg.  0,34 s
KVM    - Avg.  0,52 s
No KVM - Avg. 20,47 s
Docker - Avg.  0,34 s

In case of Docker, direct access to the MMU is performed => no overhead.
In case of KVM, a dedicated hardware unit is used to translate Guest Physical Address into Host Physical Address => small overhead.
In case of No KVM, shadow page tables are used. Every page fault leads to a so-called VM exit, i.e. switching the contexts from the guest to the host => quite expensive.


Disk benchmark questions:
1. Look at your disk write measurements. How do they differ between the platforms, what are the main reasons for the differences?

Native - Avg.  787,73 IOPS
KVM    - Avg. 1038,48 IOPS
No KVM - Avg.  560,60 IOPS
Docker - Avg.  381,17 IOPS



2. Which disk format did you use for qemu? How do you expect this benchmark to behave differently on other disk formats?



Fork benchmark questions:
1. Look at your fork sum measurements. How do they differ between the platforms, what are the main reasons for the differences?

Native - Avg.  0,81 s
KVM    - Avg.  1,02 s
No KVM - Avg. 17,93 s
Docker - Avg.  1,03 s

In case of No KVM, privileged instructions, needed for a fork, have to be trapped and emulated.

Nginx benchmark questions:
1. Look at your nginx measurements. How do they differ between the platforms, what are the main reasons for the differences?

Native - Avg.  0,14 s
KVM    - Avg. 40,19 s
No KVM - Avg. 64,06 s
Docker - Avg.  0,17 s

2. How are these measurements related to the disk benchmark findings?
